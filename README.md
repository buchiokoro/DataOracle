# Subscription-Based Data Oracle

A decentralized data oracle system built on the Stacks blockchain that enables smart contracts to access reliable off-chain data through a subscription-based model.

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized oracle system where:
- Users can subscribe to access real-time data feeds
- Data providers can register as oracles by staking STX
- Community voting ensures data quality and oracle reliability
- Multiple data types are supported (weather, financial, sports, etc.)

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- `data-oracle.clar`: Main contract handling subscriptions and data feeds
    - Subscription management
    - Oracle registration
    - Data submission
    - Voting system
    - Administrative functions

### Data Structures
```clarity
;; Subscription tracking
(define-map subscriptions
    { subscriber: principal }
    { 
        active: bool,
        expiration: uint,
        subscription-type: (string-utf8 10)
    }
)

;; Oracle registry
(define-map oracles
    { oracle-id: uint }
    {
        provider: principal,
        data-type: (string-utf8 20),
        votes: uint,
        active: bool,
        stake: uint
    }
)

;; Data feed storage
(define-map data-feeds
    { oracle-id: uint, timestamp: uint }
    {
        value: (string-utf8 50),
        provider: principal,
        verified: bool
    }
)
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-oracle.git
cd data-oracle
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up your local Stacks blockchain:
```bash
npm install -g @stacks/cli
stacks-node start
```

4. Deploy the contract:
```bash
clarinet contract:deploy data-oracle
```

## Usage

### Subscribing to Data Feeds

```clarity
;; Subscribe to data feeds
(contract-call? .data-oracle subscribe "premium")

;; Check subscription status
(contract-call? .data-oracle get-subscription tx-sender)
```

### Registering as an Oracle

```clarity
;; Register as an oracle
(contract-call? .data-oracle register-oracle "weather")

;; Submit data
(contract-call? .data-oracle submit-data u1 "72.5")
```

### Voting on Oracles

```clarity
;; Vote for an oracle
(contract-call? .data-oracle vote-oracle u1)
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

The test suite includes:
- Unit tests for all contract functions
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Edge case testing
- Security verification

### Test Coverage
- Subscription management
- Oracle registration
- Data submission
- Voting system
- Administrative functions
- Error handling

## Security

### Security Features
- Stake requirement prevents malicious oracle behavior
- Community voting system ensures data quality
- Subscription expiration handling
- Access control for administrative functions
- Data verification system

### Best Practices
1. Always verify subscription status before accessing data
2. Monitor oracle voting patterns
3. Regularly update stake requirements based on STX value
4. Implement gradual stake unlocking for oracles
